            have a bowl of parrot seeds and pellets. They also love millets whcih can be hang
            on top of the cage.</p> 
            
            <p class="linetwo">Always make sure to have fresh water inside thier cage. You might need
            to clean the water bowl serveral times a day to keep it clean and fresh through out the day. Keeping their cage clean 
            daily will also help avoid fungal disease.</p>
            
            <p class="linethree">It's also a good idea to feed them fresh fruits and vegetables. Chop up some furits or vegetables that 
            you're preparing for yourself and place some of it in their food dish.</p>
