            to exercise their beak.</p>
            
            <p class="linetwo">Provide a cage that is large enough to accomodate lots of toys to keep them entertain while
            you're at work. Large enough for a swing to swing, ropes and chew toys. Twisted cotton ropes, ladder, and especially swing will keep them busy.
            A grooming perch is a good idea to keep their nails trimmed.
